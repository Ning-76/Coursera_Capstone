Data
The data I used in the project is listed as below:
1.	Table of postal codes of Canada, Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M.
2.	Use the Geocoder package or the csv file to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods. 
3.	Foursquare location data: 
According to the geographical coordinates, we can find the venues info around.
